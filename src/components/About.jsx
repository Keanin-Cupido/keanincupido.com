						<p>
						From a young age, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by the fusion of art and technology. My journey began with traditional creative outlets like sketching, digital art, and design, alongside an exploration of the rapidly advancing tech world. Growing up during the digital revolution, I watched basic tools evolve into sophisticated devices, deepening my appreciation for how technology enhances and reshapes human experiences.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
						This curiosity drove me to explore web development, where I learned key principles of web design, user experience, and the value of community-driven innovation. These early experiments in customization and optimization shaped my passion for building intuitive, performance-driven web applications.
